# About
Python implementation of optimal local (Smith-Waterman) and global (Needleman-Wunsch) alignment algorithms. This is a school project. If you are looking for a good one, you're in the wrong place.

# Features
Nothing. Literally, why are you still reading this ?
* align any pair of sequences (nucleic, protein, ...)
* modifying parameters such as match/mismatch/gaps in a shitty way
* cannot handle multiple alignment with the same score
* cannot handle fasta format, yeah, it can't
* cannot breakdance

# Dependencies
Well, apparently you're brave enough to come here so
* Python. Yeah, you need Python for running this python script
* numpy
* RE (I love regexp so, you need to import this and deal with it.)
